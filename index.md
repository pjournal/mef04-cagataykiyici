# Hello Folks!
My  undergraduate degree is from ITÜ Management Engineering, a multi-disciplinary program, an odd mixture of business, economics, law and a pinch of engineering. I had an MBA i from Manchester Business School  after 6 years of work experience. Excited to go back to school after 15 years. Although I have always been at the data and analytical side of business in my career, this will be the most technical degree I will get. 

I’m a consultant with 20+ years of experience on a wide range of “digital” spectrum; marketing, advertising, analytics, digital platforms & CX. Throughout my career, I have worked on different but complementary contexts including digital media, portals, advertising agencies, consulting, start-ups and marketing research. During my last 12 years as a consultant, especially due to my long term collaboration with Wunderman Thompson, I had the opportunity to engage with a diverse set of leading clientele from pharma, FMCG, mobility, automotive, energy and banking.

I recently left agency side, and launched an independent CX consultancy, [Co-Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/company/co-partnersco) with my long time friend and business partner. We are currently consulting a VC backed SAAS scale-up, helping textile manufacturer & retailer to grow its e-commerce operations and  advising an upcoming Youtube content project on sustainability. 

My strongest data skills comes from marketing research background and long time experience on digital analytics (Hey I'm one of the first beta users of Google Analytics!) and related performance / search engine marketing disciplines.  

My short term goal is to improve my performance in delivering data analytics related projects to my clients. Data and analytics competency is the key component for measurement, decision making, optimization and personalization in CX management.
